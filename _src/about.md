# About Rowan

Hello! I'm Rowan from Vancouver, Canada. ðŸ‘‹

I love the web. It's the open platform that has connected me with countless
people and ideas. Its potential gets me excited!

I'm here to help make it even better by:

1. Delivering exceptional user experiences
2. Learning the possibilities and constraints of web technologies
3. Tearing down as many barriers between 1 and 2 as I can

## Background

I studied [interaction design][siat] at SFU, worked at [Mobify][mobify] for
over 2 years in an interdisciplinary marketing team, then left to work as a
contractor. After a year of helping clients with front-end execution, I
[joined the team][joining-bench] at [Bench][bench] for a new adventure as a
front-end software engineer in May of 2016.

## Community

Find me in the Vancouver design &amp; development community helping organize the
bi-monthly [Style & Class][style-class] meetup as well as the yearly
[SIAT Design Jam][design-jam]. I speak publicly, too, but I don't have any
videos to share with you. ðŸ˜©

I also help run [The Nacho Club][nacho-club], where we review the nachos of
Vancouver. [The Mexican][the-mexican] is currently our highest rated spot.

## Right Now

- Working on a new content marketing platform for [Bench](https:///bench.co)
- Organizing [Style & Class][style-class]'s upcoming event ðŸ‘€
- Redesigning [The Nacho Club][nacho-club] site ðŸ”‘
- Leveling up my JavaScript skillz ðŸ’¯

And of course, you can find me around the internets.
