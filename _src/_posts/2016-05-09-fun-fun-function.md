If you're a programmer, you've got to check out [this YouTube channel][fun-fun-function].

**Protip: watch his videos in order!** The videos make the most sense if you
watch them sequentially.

I love how he breaks down the underlying principles that power a lot of modern
JavaScript libraries and frameworks. If you don't have a rigorous
computer science background, this sort of thing is very useful.

Here's one of my favourites:

> Great software is built by great teams, not great developers.

What a guy!
