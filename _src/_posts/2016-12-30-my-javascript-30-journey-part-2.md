Hello! This is part 2 of a 5 part series sharing my learnings from Wes Bos'
[#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) challenge / course. If you haven't
already, check out my [first post](/blog/my-javascript-30-journey/) before
continuing along. By doing JavaScript exercises every day for 30 days and
sharing what I learn, I hope to better solidify all of this knowledge. Feel free
to join! Let me know if you do so I can cheer you on too.

Let's get to work!
