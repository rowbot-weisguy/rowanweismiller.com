Improving my JavaScript skills is important to me. It's like the English of
programming languages right now, so I'm glad I started my career out on the web
where JS was born. It is a very flexible language, and so there are a vast
number utilities and frameworks created to champion different approaches. The
JavaScript zeitgeist is felt strongly by those in the field of front-end
development.

With all this going on, I have a basic problem: I haven't written enough
JavaScript to _really_ grok the context for the language's development. I'm a
relative noob in the JS world. I've only been writing JS for 3 years, and only
in the last year has it become more of a focus for me.

So I decided to take Wes Bos' [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) coding
challenge. I want to document it so I get more out of it while sharing what I
learn with others, so this is my first out of 4 posts on this. I'll put out one
post per week sharing my experiment via CodePen with a short recap.

Let's get to work!
