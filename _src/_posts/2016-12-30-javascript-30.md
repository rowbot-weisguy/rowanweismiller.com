Improving my JavaScript skills is important to me. It's like the English of
programming languages right now, so I'm glad I started my career out on the web
where JS was born. It is a very flexible language, and so there are a vast
number of utilities and frameworks created to support different approaches.

With all this going on, I have a basic problem: I haven't written enough
JavaScript to _really_ grok the context for the language's development. I'm a
relative noob in the JS world. I've been writing JS on-and-off for maybe 3
years, but it's only in the last year it's become a focus for me.

With that in mind, I decided to take Wes Bos'
[#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) coding challenge. It's a bit more
like a course, actually. It's like working through 30 days of exercises with the
solutions explained along the way. I'm documenting my learnings so I get more
out of it while also sharing with others. With 30 days of coding, I'll make 5
posts with 6 projects in each one, and a new post will be up every week.

Let's get to work!

## 1 - Keyboard Drumkit

This project maps the keys A through L on the keyboard to a corresponding drum
sound effect, and shows a visual key as feedback for the user. When a key is
tapped, a short transition effect gets played on the visual representation of
that key.

Here's a CodePen:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="pRozGq" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Keyboard Drumkit" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/pRozGq/">Keyboard Drumkit</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Use `forEach` to iterate through a NodeList, as was done with `keys` here
2. Prefer named functions for use as event callbacks
3. For data attributes, keep it simple! I don't always need to get the element
and search its `dataset` to take advantage of the selectors.

A nice easy start :)

## 2 - CSS + JS Clock

This project makes a clock using JavaScript's built-in `Date` function. It's a
bit simpler than the first project.

Here's a CodePen:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="LxYPaN" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="CSS + JS Clock" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/LxYPaN/">CSS + JS Clock</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

It wasn't part of the instructions, but I called `setDate()` once at the end
just to make sure the clock is correct on page load, rather than waiting a full
1000ms for `setInterval` to fire.

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Using CSS transform's `rotate()` property can exceed 360deg and it will still
look normal as it wraps back around (i.e. 365deg looks the same as 5deg). Like,
duh, but I never tried.

## 3 - Playing with CSS Variables and JS

This project controls an image's styling with some basic inputs (sliders, color
picker) in order to demonstrate the power of CSS variables.

Anyway!

Data attributes and `dataset`.

Here's a CodePen:

<p data-height="265" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mRbWwb" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Playing with CSS Variables and JS" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/mRbWwb/">Playing with CSS Variables and JS</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

I enjoyed this one because Wes took a moment to talk about a few small details.

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Wes talked a bit about Node Lists, indirectly addressing the first comment I
made on Project 1. He explained that there is very limited functionality on the
NodeList's prototype, meaning we don't get cool functions like `map`, `reduce`,
or `filter`. When we need those kinds of functions, we can convert a NodeList
into an Array. I've done this before, but I wasn't sure when or not to do it.

2. This exercise actually use the `dataset` property of an element to access the
values of the data attributes on it. The difference between this one and the
first exercise's use of data attributes, is that accessing `dataset` isn't picky
about whether or not a certain data attribute is present, whereas the selector
predicts an element will exist with a certain attribute value.

3. CSS variables are accessible via JavaScript on any DOM node using `style`'s
`setProperty` method. In the following function example, we are listening to
updates on input elements, and then re-assigning a CSS variable on the document
root with the same `name` as the input, and using the input's value as the CSS
variable's value.

```js
function handleUpdate(e) {
  const suffix = this.dataset.sizing || '';
  document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--${this.name}`, this.value + suffix);
}
```

Great stuff! I understand better now how CSS variables are better than the SASS
equivalent.

## 4 - Array Cardio

This was a pure JS exercise in array manipulation using higher order functions.

I loved it! It was quite fun. This is stuff I'm already getting a bit familiar
with in my work at Bench and often have fun solving.

Here's a CodePen:

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="RKbVgK" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Array Cardio" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/RKbVgK/">Array Cardio</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. There's a `console.table()` method that's handy for printing out arrays of objects, which is pretty common for me.
2. `Array.prototype.sort()` will automatically sort descending (for numberic arrays) or alphabetically (for string arrays) when called without passing any arguments.

One note, looking at this code example:

```js
const streetsWithDe = links
                        .map(link => link.textContent)
                        .filter(text => text.includes('de'));
```

That `includes()` function is available to both `Array.prototype` and
`String.prototype`, but it's a tad confusing that the `String.prototype`
implementation is an ES6 standard, while the `Array.prototype` implementation is
an ES7 standard.

## 5 - Flex Panels

This was a mostly CSS driven exercise with a little bit of JS for class toggles.

Here's the CodePen:

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="MJgmGx" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Flex Panels" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/MJgmGx/">Flex Panels</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. When writing something like `flex: 5`, it means that flex-item will take up
5x the remaining flexible space compared to its sibling flex-items.
2. Flexbox rules!

## 6 - Ajax Type Ahead

This project simulated the need to get results back from a search field for US
cities and states.

Here's the CodePen:

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="PWYmgR" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="rowbot_weisguy" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="AJAX Type Ahead" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy/pen/PWYmgR/">AJAX Type Ahead</a> by Rowan Weismiller (<a href="http://codepen.io/rowbot_weisguy">@rowbot_weisguy</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

Here's what I enjoyed / learned from the project:

1. Wes made a point about getting your data ready first before you start
worrying about how you'll render it. It reminded me of the kitchen principle to
have everything _mise en place_.
2. How to use the `RegExp` constructor in JS to dynamically create a regex with a variable term.
3. The UI pattern of highlighting the search term's appearance within the results.

That's part one! If you like what I'm sharing here, then I highly encourage you
to go to the [#JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) site and sign up to get
this sent to you. It's a fun way to flex your web development muscle. Starting a
practice of coding every day is something I'm excited about.

If you do start, let me know! I want to cheer you on.
